// Make and Build Your Own Game

// This game is a trivia game and will have random questions for users to try to get correctly. After a certain amount of time that is showed by a timer the game stops and will show the user their scores.

// For the first page, the user will have three options to choose from. I did this because not everyone wants to play a basic trvivia game and I know as a user I would like 
to have certain options I can choose from because not everyone knows about sports or food etc. Because of that fact, I made: 

//General Trivia Game

// A general trivia option. This opttion will have every type of questiion in its bank. This option is for users who would like to test and see how much they know about 
every genre of trivia question. This option is for users who are confident that theey know a lot about well... a lot.

// Movie Trivia Game

// A movie trivia game. This option is for users who are ell versed in the world of movies and who would like to quiz themselves on that. This is most likely the option I would
pick because I know a lot about movies. This option will contain questions related to movies such as: "Where did Coraline from the movie "Coraline" live?"

// Brands Trivia Game

// This option is for user who are well versed in the world of brands. This is for users who want to test themselves on when a certain brand was created, who founded the brand 
etc...  an example question would be: "When was the popukar fast food resturant "mcdonalds" founded?"

// Depending on what option you click, the next page will be an "instructions" page before you begin. There will be two drop downs when you click on "timer" and "reset." There will also be a big start button that when clicked, will take you to the actual game. In the descripttion of "reset" it will explain that you can reset the game if you want to try again or beat your score. When you click the "timer" drop down option, this will explain thatt you will have one minute to complete as many questions as possible.

// When you pick the gernal trivia game option, it will have the same timer and reset drop down buttons with the same instructions. There will also be an "overveiw" drop down button that will explain that this one is a general trivia game that will have all types of questions and that it wont be themed. It will also have a big "start" button that will take you to the game.

// When you pick tthe movie trivia game option, it will have the same timer and reset drop down buttons with the same instructions. As well as a big start button taking you to the game.

// When you pick the brand trivia game option, it will have the same timer and reset drop down buttons with the same instructions. As well as a big start button taking you to the game.

// When you press start there will be a "time left" box that will show the user how much time they have left to answer the questions. There will also be a box with the question in it as well as a box directly under with the answer options. There will be a check or an x icon with numbers next to them at the top showing the user how many they got right or wrong.

// The final page will be "your scores" this page will show the user how many they got right, wrong, and how many they answered in total in one minute. There will also be a button labeled "return to main menu" which will take the user back to the beginning, or a "reset" button to take you back to the game with all new questions so you can try to beat your score.

// This game will be bright and colorful with a lot of neons and gifs. The fonts will be "crazy" and bold and exciting. This game will be called "trivia tango" and will be a fun way to test yourself.
