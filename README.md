# Project-1
// Make and Build Your Own Game

// This game is a trivia game and will have random questions for users to try to get correctly. After the player answers all of the questions the game stops and will show the user their scores.

// For the first page, the user will have two options to choose from. I did this because not everyone wants to play a basic trvivia game and I know as a user I would like to have certain options I can choose from.

//Sports Trivia Game

// A Sports trivia option. This option will have questions all about sports. This option is for users who would like to test and see how much they know about 
Sports. This option is for users who are confident that they know a lot about the world of sports.

// Movie Trivia Game

// A movie trivia game. This option is for users who are well versed in the world of film and who would like to see how much they know. This is most likely the option I would pick because I know a lot about movies. This option will contain questions related to movies such as: "Where did Coraline from the movie "Coraline" live?"

// This game will be colorful and visually pleasing. 
the first page will have the "movie trivia" option (button) and the "sport trivia" option (button) as well as a box showing the rules/information of the game. 

// The layout of the actual trivia game part will be a question and then a submit box where the user can type in their answers and submit them. After they submit their answer they will get a "you are correct" or "you are wrong" and then another question will appear.

// Reset rules: there will be an option at the end of every game to reset and try again.

// Stats: at the end of every game there will be how many questions you got right or wrong.


// This will be a fun game to test players on their knowledge of their favorite niches!
