# Project-1
// Make and Build Your Own Game

 // Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavScript.

 // Link to live sight:

// Installation Instructions: 
Through GitHub repo or my link to my live sightt.


// Approach Taken: 
With this game, I made a sports trivia game because I know that it is a very popular trivia to play and a lot of people will use this genre of trivia game. So if i were to release this it would be more popular than more of a "niche" genre. I wanted this to be a fun game for people who are interested in sports to play and test their knowledge.


// User Stories:
I want the users tto be able to hop on a colorful vibrant game with questions about their favorite topic, sports! This will be where they can test their knwowledge and get the highest score! I made a colorful background and engaging questions. At the end of the game there are their scores that show how many they got right or wrong along with a reset button that will allow them to reset their game and try to beat their previous score. The questions will be randomized so they cant just copy down the questions they already answered. There will also be a "you got it!" or "Try again!" when the user answers the question.


// BUGS:
there is a problem with my game to where when you answer it wont go to the next question.
