// Make and Build Your Own Game

// This game is a Sports trivia game and will have random questions for users to try to get correctly. After the user answers all of the questions, the game stops and will show the user their scores and have an option to reset the game and try again.

// For the first page the user will see a "Play now!" button that will take them to the game as well as a box showing the reset and scores information. I did this so the information about the game is clear and not confusing

//Sports Trivia Game

// This game is for users who would like to test and see how much they know about sports. This game is for users who are confident that they know a lot about the world of sports.

// This game will be colorful and visually pleasing with easy to use functions to make the game enjoyable for the players. 

// The layout of the actual trivia game part will be a question and then a submit box where the user can type in their answers and submit them. After they submit their answer they will get a "you are correct" or "you are wrong" and then another question will appear.

// Reset rules: there will be an option at the end of every game to reset and try again.

// Stats: at the end of every game there will be how many questions you got right or wrong.


// This will be a fun game to test players on their knowledge of their favorite niches!
